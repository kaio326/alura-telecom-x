# Telecom X - Customer Churn Analysis

Telecom X faces a significant challenge: a growing number of customers are canceling their services. To address this issue, the company launched the **Customer Churn Analysis Project**, aiming to uncover the main causes of customer loss and provide actionable insights.

In this project, we apply **data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis** techniques using **Python** and its key data science libraries. Throughout this process, we identify patterns, correlations, and potential risk factors that influence customer decisions to leave the company.

The insights generated here will serve as a foundation for the Data Science team to:
- Build predictive machine learning models.
- Develop targeted retention strategies.
- Reduce the overall churn rate and improve long-term customer engagement.
